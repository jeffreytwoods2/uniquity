# uniquity
MERN app to see if you're the first person to send a specific number to my database. This is the updated version of the app found in the unique-num repo. It was easier to start over to make it a true MERN-stack app than to integrate React later on.

## Overview

Send a number to my db and see if you're the first person to think of it! This is my first MERN-stack web app, and it uses stateful React components.

<hr />

## How to Use

Click on the link, type in a number, and send it. My validation checks should catch any errors or naughty behavior on your end.

## Under the Hood

This is a MERN app, so it uses the following tech:

<ul>
    <li>HTML/CSS/Bootstrap</li>
    <li>MongoDB</li>
    <li>Express.js</li>
    <li>React.js</li>
    <li>Node.js</li>
    <li>Regex</li>
    <li>Mongoose</li>
</ul>

<hr />

## Future Development

Converting this app to a single-page React app was the biggest priority, but there are still a few more features one could implement:

<ol>
    <li>If a number isn't unique, display how many times it has been attempted. This would need to be implemented soon to catch the most data possible.</li>
    <li>If a number isn't unique, display the first time it was ever attempted.
        <ul>
            <li>Could be absolute, eg. "This number was attempted on 4/20/2021."</li>
            <li>Could also be relative, eg. "This number was attempted 5 minutes after the app was created."</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
